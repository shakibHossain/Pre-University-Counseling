                <h5>In order to eliminate these risks and stress, we designed this project which is a PRE-UNIVERSITY COUNSELING software. An online student assessment system, analyzing the capability and interest of the students. And helping them determine their subject and department of interest.
                </h5>
                <h5>In this project, we have tried our best to come up with solution to a problem which affects a large percentage of students. From field work to programming, every single part of the project has been given special attention and outmost hard work from all the members of the group. Without the support of our faculty, Miss Sonia Corraya this project would not have been possible. Support of our Chairperson Haider Ali Sir was also extremely helpful as he pointed out to us a lot of suggestions for our Questionnaire. We are also thankful to the various faculty members who helped us verify the questions for all the departments.
                Hopefully this hard work will not be in vain and will be a help to many of the coming youngsters.
