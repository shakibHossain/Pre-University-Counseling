                <h5>We believe to select a career besides interest, a student's potential or abilities and opportunities
                should also be taken into consideration.In order to help them in such career related decisions,
                we came up with this system. </h5>
                <h5>In order to eliminate these risks and stress, we designed this project which is a PRE-UNIVERSITY COUNSELING software. 
                  An online student assessment system, analyzing the capability and interest of the students. 
                  And helping them determine their subject and department of interest.
